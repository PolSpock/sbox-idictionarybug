This repository was for a new issue, but i've just found someone who have already wrote it : https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-issues/issues/2018

The issue is caused by namespace different from the "original" networkable class namespace :
https://github.com/PolSpock/sbox-idictionarybug/blob/e435eeec5103f45bf6e8c406d1e8b6d81347f489/code/thebuggyfolder/MyNetworkableObject.cs#L4
